# Food and Drinks counter
This is a personal project I have created to make a food and drinks "bar tab" counter to be used for New Meta Gaming Arena 

## Motivation
New Meta Gaming Area is an independent Gaming cafe based in Angel, Greater London, described to have High-End PCs, Private rooms, Streaming room and Consoles. Social events, tournaments and amazing food and drinks.

Whilst working for them, there were often events or big groups of people who would want to pull all food and drink expenses put into one bill at the end of a gaming session, for convenience. This would often lead us the staff to tally the cost on a random Excel page to keep track of the food and drink ordered. Although this method worked, for me, I would struggle to tally up all of the products, as there were no immediate features that did that for that sole task and I could clearly see the numbers and texts attributed to the products and put that our in-house billing system, gLeap. Because my disability affects my cognitive processing of words and numbers, it was a difficult task to constantly cross-reference back to and took a long time. Additionally, other people would not be able to see when someone had already put down a product and it would be tallied more than once or missed in the billing process.

For a resolution to aid my dyslexia and have more organisation while producing a tab, I created the Food and Drinks counter that aided in resolving the problems of this specific task. 

## Build status
Complete with intentions to add more features such as: 
- invoice function
- send an invoice to email function
- photos with products
- adding comments
- integration with ggLeap
- login profile and database with SQL to keep a history of invoices
